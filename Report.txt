--> This Zip folder contains two .py files and one test file
      (i) Quantum_CAD.py :main code for synthesis of the circuit from TT
      (ii) Reversible_from_tt.py:  Helper code in case you want to make your circuit reversible

--> Directions to run
     (i) store your truth table (reversible) in input.txt. In case your TT is not reversible, you can make it using Reversible_from_tt.py. If it is already reversible then no need to run the code
     (ii) run Quantum_CAD.py to get final Quantum circuit description

--> Input.txt looks like this:
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1

each row corresponds one bit of output, while each column corresponds input bits. i.e. here first column corresponds to 000, second to 001 and so on


--> Declaration
      (i) We have not referred any GitHub repo or online implementations for this project. This code is completely written by our team. 
      (ii) Tools like chatGPT were used only to refine or optimise certain functions but most of the functions were written by team members only.
